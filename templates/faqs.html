                <p>
                    <strong><u>Absolutely!</u></strong> All keystrokes are stored securely in an encrypted database. 
                    You can also enable additional encryption for your logged data, and only you have access to your devices' information.

                </h6>
                <p>
                    Currently, our keylogger supports both <strong>macOS</strong> and <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems. 
                    Each platform has its own optimized implementation for maximum reliability and performance.

                </h6>
                <p>
                    Simply click the "New Connection" button in the dashboard, select your operating system, 
                    and follow the setup instructions. Once connected, you can start/stop logging and view 
                    the collected data at any time.

                    <i class="fas fa-key text-primary pe-2"></i> Do I need special permissions?
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Yes. On macOS, you'll need to grant Accessibility permissions in System Preferences. 
                    On Windows, you may need to run the application with administrator privileges. These 
                    permissions are required for the keylogger to function properly.

                </h6>
                <p>
                    Keystrokes are collected in real-time and saved to the database every few seconds. 
                    The device status is updated every 30 seconds, and you can manually refresh the 
                    dashboard at any time.

                </h6>
                <p>
                    Yes! You can remove any device from your dashboard, which will automatically delete 
                    all associated keystroke data. Your privacy is important to us, and you have full 
                    control over your data.

                <p>
                    Yes, you can monitor multiple devices simultaneously. Each device will appear in your 
                    dashboard with its own controls and log history. You can easily switch between devices 
                    and manage them independently.

                <p>
                    Currently, you can view all logged keystrokes directly in the dashboard. We're working 
                    on adding export functionality to allow downloading logs in various formats for further 
                    analysis.

                <p>
                    The dashboard shows real-time status updates for all your devices. You can see when a 
                    device is active, logging, or disconnected. We're working on adding email notifications 
                    for important status changes.
